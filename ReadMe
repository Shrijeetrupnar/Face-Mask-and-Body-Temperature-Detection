Face Mask and Body Temperature Detection | Team Member | Binghamton, NY                   September 2020 – December 2020

●	Implemented face mask and body temperature detection to be installed as a security clearance system that allows person to enter if they are wearing a face mask and their body temperature is below threshold 
●	Utilized a smart door locking and unlocking feature through the implementation of Raspberry Pi Module as computation device and Non-Contact Infrared Thermometer MLX90614 for body temperature detection
●	Applied OpenCV and tensor-flow to train the facemask data, with an accuracy of 90%
●	Presented final design including all technical aspects to students and faculty



Equipments needed:
Raspberry pi (any model 3)
MLX90614 temperature sensor.
Screen for displaying message.
Buzzer
LEDs (green, red)
Servo Motor for door.

On system(we were using Laptop)
Run the facemask_train python file to train the model. // need to train once.
Run detection python file to detect the face mask.
Run datasend python file to send the data collected to Raspberry. (You need to change the ip accordingly) 

On Raspberry pi
Run temperature.py
